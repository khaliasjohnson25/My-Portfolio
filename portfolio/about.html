<div class="about-me">
I am a first generation web developer.
I am a wife and mom to three beautiful children.
I have two girls and a baby boy.
I attended West Virginia State and UDC before I found my true passion for tech.
I am currently a stay at home mom.
I love traveling and visiting new places. My goal is to visit every Disney park and place my feet on each an every continent. 
My all time favorite place that I have visited is Cabo-San Lucas, it was so peaceful.
